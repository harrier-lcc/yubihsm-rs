Pure Rust reimplementation of [libyubihsm] providing an end-to-end encrypted
connection and command interface to [YubiHSM2] devices from [Yubico].

## About

This is a pure-Rust client which supports interfacing with [YubiHSM2] devices
over an encrypted channel.

It presently reimplements a small subset of the of the functionality of
**libyubihsm**, a closed-source C library which acts as a libcurl-based HTTP(S)
client and sends commands to the [yubihsm-connector] process, which implements
an HTTP(S) server which sends the commands to the YubiHSM2 hardware device over
USB.

Note that this is **NOT** an official Yubico project and is in no way supported
or endorsed by Yubico (well, whoever runs their Twitter account
[thinks it's awesome])

## Status

Initial support for creating encrypted channels to a YubiHSM2 via
**yubihsm-connector** is complete, along with authenticating to the
YubiHSM2 via a password/authentication key.

The following commands are presently supported:

* [Authenticate Session](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Authenticate_Session.html)
* [Blink](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Blink.html)
* [Create Session](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Create_Session.html)
* [Delete Object](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Delete_Object.html)
* [Echo](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Echo.html)
* [Generate Asymmetric Key](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Generate_Asymmetric_Key.html)
* [Get Object Info](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Get_Object_Info.html)
* [Get Pubkey](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Get_Pubkey.html)
* [List Objects](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/List_Objects.html)
* [Session Message](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Session_Message.html)
* [Sign Data EdDSA](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Sign_Data_Eddsa.html) i.e. Ed25519 signatures

## Getting Started

The main type you'll want to check out is `Session`. Here is an example of
how to connect to [yubihsm-connector] and perform an Ed25519 signature:

```rust
extern crate yubihsm;
use yubihsm::Session;

// Default host, port, auth key ID, and password for yubihsm-connector
let mut session = Session::create_from_password(
     "http://127.0.0.1:12345",
     1,
     "password",
     true
).unwrap();

// Note: You'll need to create this key first. Run the following from yubihsm-shell:
// `generate asymmetric 0 100 ed25519_test_key 1 asymmetric_sign_eddsa ed25519`
let response = session.sign_data_eddsa(100, "Hello, world!").unwrap();
println!("Ed25519 signature: {:?}", response.signature);
```

## Build Notes

This crate depends on the `aesni` crate, which uses the new "stdsimd" API
(which recently landed in nightly) to invoke hardware AES instructions via
`core::arch`.

To access these features, you will need both a relatively recent
Rust nightly and to pass the following as RUSTFLAGS:

```
RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes`
```

You can configure your `~/.cargo/config` to always pass these flags:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-Ctarget-feature=+aes"]
```

## Contributing

If there are additional [YubiHSM2 commands] you would like to use but aren't
presently supported, adding them is very easy, and PRs are welcome!

The YubiHSM2 uses a simple, bincode-like message format, which largely consists
of fixed-width integers, bytestrings, and bitfields. This crate implements a
[Serde-based message parser] which can automatically parse command/response
messages used by the HSM derived from a corresponding Rust struct describing
their structure.

Here's a list of steps necessary to implement a new command type:

1. Find the command you wish to implement on the [YubiHSM2 commands] page, and
   study the structure of the command (i.e. request) and response
2. Add a struct which matches the structure of the command to [commands.rs]
3. Add an additional struct which matches the response structure to [responses.rs]
4. Add a wrapper function to [session.rs] which constructs the command message,
   performs the command, and returns the corresponding response struct.
5. (Optional) Implement the command in [mockhsm/mod.rs] and write an
   [integration test]

Here is an [example PR that implements Ed25519 signing] you can study to see
what the above steps look like in practice.

## Testing

This crate allows you to run the integration test suite in two different ways:
live testing against a real YubiHSM2 device, and simulated testing using
a MockHSM service which reimplements some YubiHSM2 functionality in software.

### `cargo test`: test live against a YubiHSM2 device

This mode assumes you have a YubiHSM2 hardware device, have downloaded the
[YubiHSM2 SDK] for your platform, and are running a **yubihsm-connector**
process listening on localhost on the default port of 12345.

The YubiHSM2 device should be in the default factory state. To reset it to this
state, either use the [yubihsm-shell reset] command or press on the YubiHSM2 for
10 seconds immediately after inserting it.

You can confirm the tests are running live against the YubiHSM2 by the LED
blinking rapidly for 1 second.

**NOTE THAT THESE TESTS ARE DESTRUCTIVE: DO NOT RUN THEM AGAINST A YUBIHSM2
WHICH CONTAINS KEYS YOU CARE ABOUT**

[yubihsm-shell reset]: https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Commands/Reset.html

### `cargo test --features=mockhsm`: simulated tests against a mock HSM

This mode is useful for when you don't have access to physical YubiHSM2
hardware, such as CI environments.

## Known issue

- Generate Asymmetric Key fails when delay is too high (e.g. Generating RSA4096 and sometimes 2048).

- Cannot Attest EDDSA (ED25519). This is an issue with YubiHSM hardware where this operation.
